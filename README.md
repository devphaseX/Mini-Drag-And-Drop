# Mini-Drag-And-Drop
This is a mini starter drag and drop project built using Typescript.
Enforcing my understanding of the language by building a fun little project 
Which enables me to apply what have learnt like decorator,type alias, classes , type infer, generic , namespace, module,
interface and many more
